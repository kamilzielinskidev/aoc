# Advent of Code 2023 solutions app

The app will describe what the Advent of Code is and will show the solutions for the 2023 edition.
The solutions will be in the form of code snippets and will be written in TypeScript, Kotlin, Rust, Go and C++.
A user will be able to select a day and a language and see the solution for that day in that language.
A user will be able to put his own data and calculate the solution for that day.
For each solution there will be a simple animation showing how the solution works.
